# Command pattern

*"FCommand is a behavioral design pattern that turns a request into a stand-alone object that contains all information about the request. This transformation lets you pass requests as a method arguments, delay or queue a requestâ€™s execution, and support undoable operations."* - [source](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/command)

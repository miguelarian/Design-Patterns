# Design Patterns

A repository with collection of design patterns written in Java.


## Class diagrams

The class diagrams are generated using [PlantUML](https://github.com/plantuml/plantuml).

You generate the images from the corresponding markdown file code. Example:

```bash
plantuml -tsvg ./Adapter/readme.md
```

You can also use the plantuml jar file from the root folder. Example:

```bash
java -jar plantuml-mit-1.2024.4.jar ./Adapter/adapterUML.txt 
```

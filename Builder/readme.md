# Builder pattern

*"Builder is a creational design pattern that lets you construct complex objects step by step. The pattern allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code."* - [source](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/builder)

I implemented two versions of this pattern

## Builder pattern (classic version)
